												<li>Select at least one prompt/ situation you have been provided and read it.</li>
                                                <li>Come up with a design solution which will solve the problem in the prompt/ situation.</li>
                                                <li>You can create your design using whatever tools you prefer. You are also free to conduct research to help you create a design solution.​</li>
                                                <li>Submit the your design solutions either in the appropriate google classroom tile or to the teacher if it's on paper.</li>

                                <li>You are living in a small dorm room big enough to only fit your bed, a chair, a bedside table and a dresser with a little walking space in between. You want to have a table you can eat at and work at inside your dorm but normal tables are too big. What can you design to solve this problem?</li>
                                <li>The sports storeroom at a school is a mess. The storage rack for bigger items aren't practical or convenient to use and the bins used to store smaller items like soccer balls take up too much space. What can you design to solve this problem?</li>
                                <li>You are camping. You've set up camp near some essential amenities which provide electricity and running water but it's a 15 minute walk away and you can't drive your car there. You don't want to run back and forth all the time to get water and electricity. What can you design to solve this problem?</li>
                                <li>The cooking pots/ pans and container storage in your kitchen is a mess. Nothing stacks up nicely so your kitchen cupboards are very cluttered and things fall out every time you open them. What can you design to solve this problem?</li>

							<h2>Task analysis:</h2>
							<p>This task is designed to stimulate student creativity and problem solving as a means to promote higher order thinking as they create design solutions for various prompts (problems/ situations) they are given (Armstrong, 2010). This task addresses outcome P3.1 (investigates and experiments with techniques in creative and collaborative approaches in designing and producing) within the preliminary Design and Technology curriculum (NESA, 2013a). Despite the lack of supporting literacy or numeracy general capabilities, this activity can be easily advanced/ further developed into a much larger task in which these capabilities will be addressed, for example, an assessment task which will require students to develop a product based on these prompts with research to back up their design decisions. Additionally, the prompts that are provided were designed to be relatable to students as they tend to learn better when they are able to relate the content to their surroundings (AITSL, n.d.). Furthermore, students were not provided with resources as a way to limit the influence of commercialised design solutions to encourage original design solutions which is one of the driving challenges for this task.</p>
